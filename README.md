Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Moses-Mtonga, a software developer based in Lusaka, Zambia. 
Here are some things you might find interesting about me:

I'm currently working on two private projects, one alone and the other with two of my friends. We're developing a web application that we hope will make people's lives easier.

I'm currently learning C# and I'm finding it to be a very intuitive language. It's a powerful tool for building applications and I'm excited to continue exploring its capabilities.I'm looking to collaborate on a web-based project in C#. I'm interested in projects that involve creating user-friendly interfaces and solving real-world problems.

Fun fact: I love watching football and I'm a huge fan of the English Premier League. I also enjoy listening to music and playing video games in my free time.

Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to discuss any projects or just connect in general. I'm always happy to chat!
